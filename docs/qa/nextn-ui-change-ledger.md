# NextN UI change ledger

This register records visible-change boundaries and their evidence. It does not
authorize an edit, replace a device comparison, or define product completion.

## OPEN — Reader per-page comic translation

- User outcome: bring the mature, NH-applicable Reader comic-translation
  capability into NextN without changing the established Reader canvas or
  existing navigation/reading controls.
- Reference parent tree: NextE `ReaderPage` owns one full-screen canvas. Its
  content surface remains first; the transparent tap surface remains above it;
  transient translation status is an overlay; Reader chrome is conditionally
  overlaid; the per-page translation action belongs in the existing top More
  menu alongside reload/image information, with an explicit optional automatic
  mode. A rendered translation only replaces the selected page image leaf; it
  does not create a second Reader, a new card, or change the chrome geometry.
- Current NextN parent tree: `ReaderPage` owns the same full-screen canvas,
  reader content, transparent tap layer, conditional top header, and one
  bottom control stack. Its existing top More menu currently owns Share,
  external open, and Reader settings. Source pages are rendered by the same
  three leaf families: vertical `ReaderImagePage`, paged `ReaderImagePage`,
  and double-page `ReaderSpreadSurface -> ReaderSpreadImageLayer`.
- Proven NH boundary: NextN source pages may be downloaded at render time by
  `ReaderImageCacheService`, while the existing parent does not retain the
  resulting app-private local path. The translation runtime requires that
  local path. The next source change must add only a leaf-to-parent local-file
  readiness projection, then route a rendered page URI back through the three
  existing image leaves. It must not alter List/Swiper/Stack ownership,
  gestures, chrome position, Reader settings, or page-progress semantics.
- Implemented source behavior: one explicit "Translate current page" item is
  added to the existing top More menu when the current page has a local source
  file. Its run uses the existing full-canvas status-overlay role from the
  reference; a successful render replaces only the current image leaf and the
  same action toggles back to the original. The source-page local-file callback
  and translated URI projection were added equally to vertical, paged, and
  double-page image leaves. Automatic translation is not included in this
  first visible boundary.
- Availability refinement: the existing Reader menu leaf now also requires a
  configured manga-source binding with the responses and image-input
  capability. A rendered result remains toggleable without rechecking source
  configuration. This prevents the unconfigured path from presenting a
  clickable action that can only fail; it does not move or add any Reader
  control.
- Before/after rationale: the runtime, local vision backend, provider bridge,
  private rendered-image cache, and private document cache now exist outside
  the Reader UI. The smallest missing connection is the existing per-page
  overflow action and image-leaf source selection. Adding a new toolbar,
  panel, list, or route would be unsupported by the reference tree.
- Visual verification plan: after an actual rendered result exists, capture
  the same gallery/page, viewport, orientation, and chrome-visible state for
  NextE and NextN. Review the More-menu placement, running/error overlay,
  original/translated toggle, single-page flow, double-page flow, and hidden
  chrome canvas. Retain raw local captures; no source-shape or synthetic UI
  check is evidence.
- Unresolved risk: current NextN does not expose a loaded remote page's local
  path to its parent, so the leaf callback must be implemented and observed
  before the translation action can be enabled for non-downloaded pages. The
  callback is now implemented in source but has not been observed on device.
  A source/provider configuration surface is also still required before an
  ordinary user can produce a translation result.
- Current device observation: after the latest signed Debug HAP was installed
  in place on the selected device, the documented direct Gallery route opened
  the native Reader and its existing overflow menu. With no configured manga
  source, the native `Translate current page` menu item was present but
  disabled. No translation was requested; no source, account, preference, or
  content data was changed. Local terminal layout and screenshot evidence is
  retained outside Git. This observes the unconfigured availability boundary
  only, not a configured translation result or visual-reference acceptance.

## OPEN — Reader comic-translation source

- User outcome: make the Reader's existing per-page comic-translation action
  configurable with one private OpenAI-compatible source and model, rather
  than leaving the action dependent on an inaccessible stored binding.
- Reference parent tree: NextE keeps source configuration outside Reader:
  Settings route → `HdsNavDestination` → `SecondaryListScaffold` →
  `ListItem` → `GroupedListSection`. Its source-detail group is ordered as a
  read-only source-type row followed by name, base URL, and password input
  leaves; the comic-translation settings owner binds a compatible source and
  model separately.
- Current NextN parent tree: the Reader settings destination already uses
  `HdsNavDestination` → `SettingsPage(READER)` → `SecondaryListScaffold` →
  `ListItem` → `NextNGroupedListSection` → `NextNListRow`. Shared code already
  owns `LlmSourceProfileRepository`, `LlmSourceSecretVault`, and the manga
  consumer binding, but no current Settings route reaches them.
- Proven NH boundary: the current runtime supports only an
  OpenAI-compatible Responses source. The new destination therefore exposes
  that supported source type and its manga binding only; it does not present
  NextE's Codex OAuth, catalog, comment-translation, Torii, or self-hosted
  leaves as if NextN implemented them.
- Before/after rationale: a single Reader-settings navigation row and one
  focused destination preserve the root Settings and Reader parent trees. The
  form writes metadata through the existing profile repository, a key only to
  the existing HUKS vault, and the selected model through the existing manga
  binding; it must never place a key in reactive shared state or diagnostics.
- Visual verification plan: compare this destination against the same-state
  NextE source-detail screen on device. Review the Reader-settings row,
  route/title chrome, grouped-form hierarchy, input insets, error treatment,
  and configured/unconfigured state. Retain raw captures locally; no
  source-shape or synthetic UI check is evidence.
- Implemented source behavior: Reader settings now owns one navigation row to
  a dedicated source destination. The destination presents the supported
  OpenAI-compatible type and the four source leaves (name, base URL, API key,
  model), then saves through the existing private repository, HUKS vault, and
  manga binding. An existing key is represented only as "stored securely";
  neither it nor any input is added to shared reactive state or diagnostics.
- Current device observation: on the selected device, the new Reader-settings
  row opened the native source destination and showed the unconfigured form
  with a masked empty key field. No field was edited and no source, model,
  account, preference, gallery, or content data was changed. Local raw
  captures are retained outside Git. This is routing/form-render evidence,
  not a same-state reference comparison or feature acceptance.

## OPEN — Reader local comic-translation model pack

- User outcome: expose the optional local detection, OCR, source-treatment,
  and rendering model pack that already exists in NextN, so a user can choose
  the mature on-device translation path instead of the current invisible
  fallback.
- Newly actionable basis: `ComicTranslationModelService` already owns one
  checksum-verified, atomic model-pack installer and remover, but its only
  current caller is the runtime's read-only readiness probe. No Settings or
  Reader owner can start the install or disclose its optional local role.
- Reference parent tree: NextE keeps local-model management inside its
  translation settings route as a `SecondaryListScaffold → ListItem →
  GroupedListSection → ConciseListRow` group. The row reports readiness, asks
  for confirmation before a download or removal, and never downloads from the
  Reader canvas.
- Current parent tree: NextN's existing translation-source route is
  `HdsNavDestination → ComicTranslationSourcePage → SecondaryListScaffold →
  ListItem → NextNGroupedListSection → NextNListRow`. Its source form,
  consumer bindings, and save group already own remote-provider configuration.
- Exact change boundary: add one optional local-model group to that same
  scaffold, after the consumer-binding group and before source save. It may
  query, install, or remove only `ComicTranslationModelService`; it must not
  alter source metadata, secret handling, consumer bindings, Reader canvas,
  automatic scheduling, or fallback behavior.
- Before/after rationale: the current runtime uses a basic local backend when
  the pack is absent, so this is a user-controlled quality upgrade rather than
  a prerequisite or hidden background download. The existing service validates
  every installed asset and writes it outside the HAP.
- Visual verification plan: on the selected device, compare the native
  translation-source route with the same-state NextE translation settings
  route. Review grouped-section order, row hierarchy, unavailable/installing/
  installed treatment, confirmation wording, and error placement. Retain raw
  local captures; no source-shape or synthetic UI check is evidence.
- Unresolved risk: the selected device has not yet shown this new group or a
  configured translation run. A build can establish only compilation, not
  visual or model-download acceptance.
- Current device observation: the signed Debug HAP was installed in place on
  the selected device, then the native path `Settings → Reader → Comic
  translation` reached the existing translation-source route. The local-model
  group rendered between the consumer bindings and save group, with its
  initial Download state visible. No source field, key, consumer switch,
  save action, model download, account, or content data was changed. Raw
  local evidence is retained in
  `.hvigor/outputs/translation-local-model-pack-20260811T0344/` and excluded
  from Git. This is native route/render evidence only, not a same-state NextE
  visual comparison or local-model processing acceptance.
- Same-device reference counterevidence: NextE was temporarily switched from
  its prior self-hosted route to its local route, captured at the same
  viewport, then restored to self-hosted with its own confirmation path. Its
  model leaf uses the established `on-device manga model → install status →
  79.0 MB/license metadata` grammar. NextN's initial `Download` trailing
  action and generic explanatory subtitle were therefore not reference
  faithful. The next edit is limited to that leaf's title, state text, and
  metadata copy; its group position, click/confirmation behavior, and
  download/remove owner remain frozen.
- Current NextN recheck counterevidence: the revised metadata was placed in
  `NextNListRow.subtitle`, so the trailing install status constrained it to a
  narrower column and produced an earlier wrap than the same-viewport NextE
  capture. NextE owns this metadata as a full-width caption *after* its model
  row. The next edit moves only that note to the sibling leaf immediately
  following the row, preserving text, row height, trailing status, action,
  confirmation, and group order.

## OPEN — Reader comic-translation automatic session mode

- User outcome: carry the existing, configured Reader comic translation from a
  one-page manual action to NextE's explicit, session-only automatic mode,
  without changing the Reader canvas or making an unconfigured source perform
  any network work.
- Newly actionable basis: the current Reader already has the same private
  local-file callback, one in-flight translation state, rendered-page leaf
  replacement, and More-menu owner needed by NextE. Source review now shows
  the missing behavior is limited to session state and work scheduling.
- Reference parent tree: NextE keeps one Reader canvas with content first,
  transparent tap surface above it, conditional chrome, and a top More menu.
  The More menu keeps the existing manual translation action and adds one
  checked automatic-translation item. Enabling opens a confirmation dialog;
  the setting lives only for the Reader session. The owner translates the
  current ready page, then at most the next ready page, serially; its rendered
  output replaces only the corresponding image leaf.
- Current parent tree: NextN has the same canvas/content/tap/chrome order and
  owns manual translation in `ReaderOverflowMenu`. Source-file readiness flows
  from all three image-leaf families to `ReaderPage`; `ReaderPage` already
  owns one in-flight translation and per-page rendered URI projection.
- Exact change boundary: add a session-only checked More-menu item and its
  confirmation dialog; add a serial current-then-next scheduler driven by
  source-file readiness, settled page navigation, and run completion. Keep
  the existing source binding gate, manual action, local cache, image leaves,
  reader gestures, progress, and chrome geometry unchanged.
- Visual verification plan: with a configured private source, compare an
  enabled More menu, confirmation dialog, current-page render, next-page
  serial handoff, failure behavior, and route exit against same-state NextE
  captures at the same viewport. Retain raw local captures. An unconfigured
  device can establish only that the new item remains disabled.
- Unresolved risk: no private manga source is currently configured on the
  selected device, so a real rendered translation and serial handoff remain
  unproven after implementation.
- Current runtime evidence: the signed Debug build was installed in place,
  then force-stopped before the documented direct Gallery route. Its visible
  Read/Continue action ended outside NextN, so the chain is rejected before
  any local Reader menu or translation behavior. No source/profile/account,
  preference, or gallery data was changed. The route failure is recorded
  separately in the active device queue; it does not establish a fault in the
  automatic-translation scheduler.

## OPEN — Gallery Detail floating Read hit-test ownership

- User outcome: the floating Read control remains an overlay and may visually
  cover the scrolling Detail content; it must nevertheless own its own tap.
  This change adds no bottom margin, content spacer, or change to its visible
  position.
- Newly actionable basis: a current fresh native Detail action point intersects
  both the floating Read control and a lower searchable tag leaf. The outer
  rail is `HitTestMode.Transparent`; the official ArkUI contract states that a
  transparent top component lets lower overlapping nodes participate in touch
  testing. The observed terminal leaves NextN, so the action chain is rejected.
- Reference parent tree: NextE uses `Detail Stack → full-width transparent
  Read rail → inner default-hit-test Row → Read button`. The inner Row owns the
  button's measured activity height and prevents the transparent rail itself
  from becoming the only parent around the action.
- Current parent tree: NextN has `Detail Stack → full-width transparent Read
  rail → Read button`. It omitted the neutral inner Row when it intentionally
  removed NextE's unsupported smart-grip translation behavior.
- Exact change boundary: restore only that inner Row with the existing
  `readFabOuterHeight()` measurement. Keep outer rail width, padding, bottom
  position, transparency, HDS/filled choice, activity height, scroll reserve,
  and all Read routing callbacks unchanged.
- Verification plan: after a data-preserving signed Debug update, use the
  documented direct Gallery route and one fresh semantic Read action. Require
  a NextN Reader terminal before making any Reader feature claim. If it still
  leaves NextN, preserve the result and do not tune geometry or repeat taps.
- Unresolved risk: the source correction establishes the reference interaction
  boundary, but the prior terminal cannot by itself prove that hit-test
  propagation was the sole cause.
- Counterevidence: the source change was built, installed in place, and
  force-stopped before the same direct route. The fresh NextN layout changed
  as expected, but one semantic Read activation still ended outside NextN.
  The inner Row was therefore reverted rather than retained as a speculative
  fix. The faulty assumption was that restoring that one reference boundary
  would determine delivery on its own; it did not. Do not alter the floating
  geometry, reserve, or hit-test tree again without a new event-delivery
  observation that distinguishes the actual owner.

## OPEN — Gallery comment translation

- User outcome: bring the mature optional comment-translation capability to
  NextN without reopening the already reviewed Comments layout, composer, or
  loading lifecycle.
- Reference parent tree: NextE owns the policy and source binding outside the
  discussion page. Its full route is `HdsNavDestination → Stack →
  PullRefreshListScaffold → ListItem → GalleryCommentsCard`; translation is a
  card-local action/state leaf. It can show cached or translated text in that
  same card, while the fixed composer remains owned by the page-level Stack.
- Current NextN parent tree: `Index` owns the existing Comments destination;
  `GalleryCommentsPage` owns `Column → PullRefreshListScaffold → ListItem →
  CommentCard`, plus its existing fixed page-footer composer. It currently
  renders the author, body, and timestamp but has no translation state or
  action. `LlmSourceProfileRepository` already owns a separate, private
  comment consumer binding; current Reader source configuration intentionally
  binds only the image-capable manga consumer.
- Proven NH boundary: comments are public NH DTO text without EH votes,
  replies, or rich span data. The new capability may add only a card-local
  translated-text/action leaf and an explicit private text-source binding. It
  must not import EH voting/reply behavior, change card/list/composer parent
  ownership, auto-submit requests, or replace the frozen Comments chrome.
- Before/after rationale: a bounded OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions
  provider and a private cache make translation optional and deterministic for
  one configured source.
  An unconfigured source keeps the action unavailable and sends no request.
- Visual verification plan: with a configured source and an existing native
  Comments route, compare the same gallery/comment viewport to NextE only for
  the card-local action, pending state, and translated-text expansion. Review
  the sibling card, list inset, and fixed composer in the same frame. Retain
  raw local captures; no source-shape or synthetic UI check is evidence.
- Unresolved risk: the selected device currently has no configured text
  translation source, so real provider execution and translated-card visual
  acceptance remain unproven. No credential, comment, or source record may be
  fabricated to obtain that state.

## OPEN — Shared translation-source configuration

- User outcome: one user-controlled private OpenAI-compatible source can be
  explicitly assigned to Reader comic translation, Gallery comment
  translation, or both; configuring one consumer must never silently enable
  the other.
- Reference parent tree: NextE keeps the entry in its settings translation
  section as a `ConciseListRow`, then owns sources through `LlmSourceManager`
  and its detail destination: `HdsNavDestination → SecondaryListScaffold →
  ListItem → GroupedListSection`. The detail form owns source type, name,
  base URL, secret input, and explicit supported-consumer capability leaves;
  consumer binding stays outside the content page.
- Current NextN parent tree: Reader Settings owns a single navigation row to
  `HdsNavDestination → ComicTranslationSourcePage →
  SecondaryListScaffold → ListItem → NextNGroupedListSection`. The profile
  repository already owns exactly two durable consumer bindings, while the
  existing form declares only Reader's Responses/image capability.
- Exact change boundary: retain the existing HDS route, list scaffold,
  grouped form and private HUKS key handling. Rename that form's semantic
  purpose to a shared translation source, add only the two explicit consumer
  switches and their durable bindings, and add one Comment Translation row to
  the existing Advanced Settings list that opens the same destination. The
  card change is restricted to the existing comment header's local action
  leaf and translated body; it must not alter the list, composer, refresh,
  route snapshot, card geometry, or comment network request.
- NH boundary: NextN supports only one OpenAI-compatible source type and no
  model catalog, Codex OAuth, Google fallback, auto-translation, or display
  mode policy. The same model string is intentionally bound only to consumers
  the user selects in this supported single-source form.
- Visual verification plan: with no source configured, compare Settings and
  a comments page against their prior same-viewport state to confirm no card
  action or layout changes are introduced. With a deliberately configured
  private source, compare the shared source form, the configured consumer
  rows, and a single translated-comment action/pending/result state against
  the corresponding NextE screens. Retain raw local captures; no source-shape
  or synthetic UI check is evidence.
- Unresolved risk: the selected device has no configured text source. The
  configured request/result path remains unproven until an existing authorized
  private source can be entered without exposing its secret.
- Current device observation: after the signed Debug update was installed in
  place on the selected device, the native Settings → Advanced → Comment
  Translation route reached this shared source form. Its default unconfigured
  fields and the explicit comment-use selection rendered without any field
  input, save, provider request, account action, preference write, or comment
  mutation. The retained local capture is route/form evidence only; it is not
  a same-state NextE comparison or a configured-provider acceptance.

## OPEN — Collection-card tag display

- User outcome: gallery listings may show the tags already supplied by the NH
  v2 list response, with the same opt-in, presentation-specific semantics as
  ErosN; raw tag ids must never be rendered as a substitute for names.
- Newly actionable basis: the user explicitly identified ErosN's gallery-tag
  display as a mature NH capability to audit against NextN. Current source
  confirms that NextN keeps each list item's `tag_ids`, but exposes only the
  three language ids; ErosN resolves those ids in a bounded local catalog and
  then renders up to ten resolved names.
- Reference parent trees: ErosN's setting is an opt-in (`showTags`, default
  off). Its regular list is `Gesture → fixed Card → Row(cover, information
  Column(title, tag leaf))`; its regular waterfall is `Gesture → Card →
  Column(cover, title, wrapping tag leaf)`; its compact waterfall is
  `Gesture → cover Stack → bottom gradient → horizontal single-line tag leaf
  → title`. Its grid card intentionally leaves the tag leaf absent.
- Current NextN parent trees: `GalleryCollectionBody` owns the refresh
  scaffold and selects `GalleryMediumCard` for LIST, `GalleryWaterfallCard`
  for WATERFALL, `GalleryWaterfallCompactCard` for WATERFALL_COMPACT,
  `GalleryGridCard` for COVER_GRID, and `GalleryCoverWallCard` for COVER_WALL.
  Its SIMPLE_LIST owner remains the independently reviewed NextE simple-row
  grammar. Layout Settings owns `SettingsPage(LAYOUT) →
  SecondaryListScaffold → BrowsePresentationGroup →
  NextNGroupedListSection → NextNListRow`.
- Exact change boundary: add a private, bounded id-to-name catalog cache and
  enrich only loaded `NhGallerySummary` snapshots. Add an explicit
  default-off display switch in the existing Browse presentation group. Add a
  tag leaf only to LIST, WATERFALL, and WATERFALL_COMPACT: wrapping tags in
  the first two and a single horizontal line in the compact cover overlay.
  Do not change collection scaffolds, request/cursor ownership, card routing,
  SIMPLE_LIST, COVER_GRID, COVER_WALL, cover geometry, language badges, or
  page-count leaves.
- Minimality rationale: resolving one de-duplicated page batch through a
  private local catalog prevents per-card requests and preserves valid list
  data if the public catalog cannot supply a name. The setting remains off
  until the user elects the denser card treatment.
- Visual verification plan: after the feature is configured on the selected
  device, compare the same loaded list and waterfall gallery set with ErosN
  at the same viewport. Review the Settings row, disabled/default-off state,
  resolved-name state, wrapping card rhythm, compact single-line overlay,
  grid/cover-wall absence, and unchanged SIMPLE_LIST/card navigation. Retain
  raw local captures; no source-shape or synthetic UI check is acceptance.
- Unresolved risk: the v2 list endpoint supplies only ids. The public catalog
  may rate-limit or omit names, so absence of resolved names must leave the
  card's existing layout intact rather than fail, block, or retry a listing.
- Current device observation: on the selected device, the default-off control
  was observed before the temporary validation change. Enabling it rendered
  resolved-name leaves in the native regular-waterfall, compact-waterfall,
  and list cards. The control was then restored to off and the presentation
  to Cover grid, both in Settings and on the terminal Gallery surface. This
  confirms the bounded native state and restoration path only; no
  same-gallery, same-viewport ErosN capture exists yet, so visual-reference
  parity remains OPEN.
- Follow-up source alignment: ErosN's existing list tag leaf selects a
  downloaded dictionary display name when available; NextN Detail already
  applies the same optional local-dictionary fallback, but the new collection
  leaf always renders the raw catalog name. The exact correction is a
  presentation-only `NhTag` display label populated from the existing local
  dictionary during the already serialized catalog enrichment. It changes no
  setting, request, cache schema, card geometry, tag query, or raw tag name;
  dictionary absence continues to show the raw name. Device review must use
  an already installed dictionary when available, otherwise this translated
  substate remains unaccepted rather than downloading a dictionary merely for
  validation.
- Current device observation for that follow-up: the installed build was
  exercised with the existing local data only. Latest initially retained an
  independent Cover-grid source override, so changing the global Setting to
  List alone did not change its renderer; after its existing source menu was
  set to Follow global, the native List showed its tag leaves. The displayed
  values were the raw-fallback form; no local dictionary substitution was
  observable in this run. Global presentation, Latest override, and the tag
  control were restored to their pre-run Cover-grid, Cover-grid, and off
  values. This is raw-fallback and restoration evidence only; the optional
  translated-label state and same-state ErosN visual comparison remain OPEN.

## OPEN — Reader enhancement interaction yield

- User outcome: local Reader super-resolution must never compete with a
  foreground reading gesture or the existing Reader settings sheet.
- Reference and current parent tree: both apps keep one full Reader canvas
  with content first, a transparent tap surface, and conditional overlay
  chrome. NextE binds the canvas touch lifecycle to its existing
  super-resolution service; NextN already exposes the same native pause API
  but does not call it from the Reader owner.
- Exact boundary: add only transient pause/resume state and timers to
  `ReaderPage`, forwarding foreground down/move/up/cancel and Reader settings
  open/close to the existing service. Do not alter page data sources, List or
  Swiper ownership, image leaves, tap-zone semantics, chrome geometry,
  settings contents, model storage, or any network request.
- Verification plan: build first. With an installed local enhancement model,
  compare a reader interaction and immediately subsequent settled page against
  NextE at the same mode and viewport; retain raw captures locally. No
  source-shape or synthetic UI check is acceptance.
- Current device observation: the selected device reported the local model as
  installed and enhancement as disabled. The compiled build was installed in
  place, but the bounded direct-gallery run did not retain a stable Reader
  terminal after the native Detail action; its terminal native state was a
  settings surface. The enhancement switch was confirmed disabled afterward
  and Browse was restored. This is not processing or interaction acceptance;
  that evidence remains OPEN.
