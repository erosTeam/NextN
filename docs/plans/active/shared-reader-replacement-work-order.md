# Shared Reader Replacement Work Order

This is the only live execution queue for replacing the NextN, NextE, and Koma
readers with `reader-kit`. The architecture document preserves design and prior
evidence. Per-app QA ledgers preserve durable counterexamples and accepted
boundaries. Neither may create a second queue.

## Outcome

Ship one shared reader whose core interaction and UI are reused by all three
apps while each host retains ownership of catalogs, cache/download services,
settings, progress, actions, navigation, and Koma chapter orchestration.

Until Package 5 is accepted, every production default remains the legacy reader
and every shared route remains optional and reversible. No package migrates or
deletes user data.

## Execution contract

1. Exactly one package is `ACTIVE`; all others are `QUEUED` or `DONE`.
2. A package starts with a current-source owner map and ends with a complete
   user path. Individual controls, callbacks, tests, screenshots, builds, and
   devices are evidence inside the package, not milestones.
3. Implement the coherent source candidate first. Then run focused state tests,
   the complete `reader-kit` suite when shared code changed, and one matching
   build of every consumer. Do not rebuild between adjacent assertions.
4. Device coverage follows risk rather than multiplication: use 197 for the
   primary phone/runtime path and 103 for tablet, rotation, responsive layout,
   or one selected cross-check. A changed shared visual/layout owner requires
   both shapes; a non-layout host adapter does not automatically require both.
5. One ignored artifact directory and one complete protocol manifest belong to
   each package/device run. Git receives no run JSON and no paragraph per run.
6. Update the table below in place. A counterexample reopens its package; it
   does not create a new phase name. Commit only a coherent package candidate or
   accepted package conclusion.

## Replacement packages

| Package | Complete user path and ownership boundary | Release evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Resource lifecycle and recovery | Open real content; load visible and adjacent originals; switch/reload the exact visible source; keep unaffected panes; fail and retry one source; retire stale work on navigation, background, close, and fresh reopen. `reader-kit` owns request/slot presentation generations; hosts own URL/file/cache/download and source scope. | Shared state suite; affected-host tests; all three consumers build if shared code changes. Primary runtime on 197 for NextE and NextN; 103 only for spread/reflow-sensitive coverage. Existing legacy routes remain usable afterward. | **ACTIVE** |
| 2. Host state and action parity | Enter from normal host state; inherit and change applicable layout/direction/spread/crop/interpolation/auto-read/keep-screen/tap/volume settings; preserve progress; execute every supported image/host action without inventing generic business behavior. | Per-host old-to-shared capability map has no silent omission; persistence cold-start path and legacy return pass; one phone run per host plus 103 only for responsive state. | QUEUED |
| 3. Entry, chrome, thumbnails, and return | Detail, all-thumbnails, and reader-rail entry use the correct source identity and thumbnail geometry; single/spread/continuous/long-image UI and failure material remain legible; rotation/window changes keep anchors; close returns to the current source position and restores system UI. | Same-state full-page review on 197 and 103 for changed responsive/transition paths; NH partial thumbnails and EH sprites use their own host contracts; no known visual counterexample. | QUEUED |
| 4. Koma chapter orchestration | Open a real multi-chapter title; explicit previous/next chapter preparation, success, failure, cancellation, rapid A-B-C selection, last-chapter semantics, per-chapter progress/read state, local/remote/provider scope, and return all remain host-owned around the shared session. | Focused orchestrator tests, Koma build, 197 phone path, 103 tablet rotation/chapter path, unchanged unrelated library/download data, and legacy Koma reader fallback. | QUEUED |
| 5. Controlled production replacement | Each app can select the shared host at the normal reader entry without debug Wants, while a single explicit fallback restores its legacy reader. Cold start, repeated entry, upgrade, and rollback preserve settings/progress/data. | One pinned `reader-kit` revision consumed by all hosts; per-app full route matrix accepted on the selected release candidate; fallback verified before any app changes its default. Default selection remains a separate explicit release decision. | QUEUED |

## Current Package 1 delta

Already established and not to be rerun unless its owner changes:

- `reader-kit` has stable page/source identities, independent adjacent slots,
  cancellation fences, retained-frame handoff, and host-owned asset providers.
- NextN has bounded device evidence for complete-download same-URI reload in
  single, continuous, and split-spread layouts.
- NextE has source switching and the same-URI reload candidate integrated in its
  optional host; shared tests and matching main/native builds have succeeded.

Still required to close Package 1:

- review and checkpoint the shared same-URI implementation as one revision;
- finish NextE's consolidated real-host reload/retry/background-close-reopen
  runtime path, proving target request generation changes and an unaffected
  spread partner remains unchanged;
- compare the current NextN and NextE host adapters for cache invalidation,
  source scope, in-flight cancellation, release, and fresh-reopen semantics;
- run the final focused suites and build all three consumers once after the
  candidate is frozen;
- execute the minimum device set selected by the risk rule above and inspect
  terminal full-screen evidence; retain any counterexample in this row.

## Single next action

Complete the current-source comparison of NextN and NextE asset providers and
freeze the Package 1 source candidate. Do not start another device run or
Package 2 work until that comparison either finds and repairs a lifecycle gap or
shows that the current candidate covers the full declared path.

## Package completion record

Update one row here when a package closes: shared revision, host commits,
focused suite result, consumer build result, selected device/artifact roots,
observed user path, preserved fallback, and explicit untested/non-applicable
branches. Do not paste command transcripts or create a second status log.
